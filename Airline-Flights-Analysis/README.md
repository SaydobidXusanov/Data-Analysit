# Airline On-Time Performance Data Exploration
## by Saydobid Khusanov


## Dataset

> This exploration is based on the 1987-2008 US flights performance data. 
> 100K rows were randomly selected from each of the year-based datasets.
> [Data Source](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009)

## Summary of Findings

* The proportions of total number of flights during the period were relatively close to each other, especially, October containing the highest proportion.
* Among all the selected flights the most common distance passed lied between the range of about 200 and 800 miles.
* When the most visited places were analysed, it was found that the Chicago Oâ€™Hare International Airport (ORD) had the most number of visits over the period.
* When data was analysed in terms of delays, some flights had to be postponed for a couple of hours, while the most number of delays were for a minute.
* The most common reason for flight cancellation was carrier, the second most common being weather, followed by NAS, and only in a few cases security.
* It was noted that the average distance passed through flights increased consistently between 1987 and early 2000's, 2000 and 2002 being the peak years.
* Interestingly enough, security delay had the most number of occurrences, with about 10-20 minutes of tardiness while being the least common for flight cancellation.
* In terms of relationships between arrival and departure delays, most of the time, departure delays equivalently impacted the arrival time.
* The average delay time of the flights among the categories almost remained stable during the period.
* Both scheduled arrival and departure hours had similar values in regard to the average mean delay time. The delay minutes seemed to have increased during the later hours.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> It is worth noting that it is necessary to identify the most common travel distances 
> to help the organisations to choose proper planes for flights. Moreover, the corresponding popularity month for the 
> flights are also important to note.
> 
> Thus, delay and cancellation reasons are essential to identify because by deeply analysing them, 
> it is possible to improve the overall flights performance. The delay types can be classified into two major categories: mechanical and everything else.
> 
> By holding this exploration, it was possible to discover interesting insights regarding mechanical delay aspects too.
> We could see that most of the delays were related to weather too, however, other issues could be hopefully improved.
> 
> It was possible to see average increase in delays on the hourly basis according to the scheduled arrival and departure times.
> Knowing these traffic times helps the organisations implement more control during these hours.
