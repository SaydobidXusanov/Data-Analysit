# Analyse A/B Test Results: E-commerce website
## by Saydobid Khusanov
## Case Description
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

* Implement the new webpage,
* Keep the old webpage, or
* Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Analysis Steps
Part I - Probability
Part II - A/B Test
Part III - Regression

## Conclusion
After going through multiple steps of in-depth analysis, the following conclusion was drawn:
>Due to the lack of time period for the tests and some other important factors such as the age and the profession of the users, it is not possible to strictly reject the new version.
>Therefore, I suggest running the experiment for an extended duration, and making sure to consider other essential user factors such as the age and the total time of presence on the platform.
