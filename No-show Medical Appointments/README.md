# Investigate a Dataset - No-show appointments
## by Saydobid Khusanov

This project includes investigating a dataset of no-show medical appointments. The following questions were posed for analysis, and the corresponding conclusions were gained.

## Conclusions

The factors that are important for us to know in which cases patients will not visit the scheduled appointment:

1. Which age and gender groups had the most number of 'No-show' cases?

*The largest number of male patients who did not come to the appointment were members of the 0-20 age group. Meanwhile, the group interval was about 20-40 for the female ones.*

2. Which locations had the most number of 'No-show' cases?

*The hospitals of JARDIM CAMBURI and MARIA ORTIZ had the most number of no-show patients during the given period with 1465 and 1219 cases, respectively.*

3. People suffering from which illness had the most number of 'No-show' cases?

*The people who suffer from hypertension did not come to the appointments most of the time compared to other provided illnesses with a noticeably large difference.*

4. Do the appointment days have an impact on the number of 'No-show' cases?

*Tuesdays and Wednesdays were the days when most patients did not show up. Nevertheless, Thursday was the day with the fewest cases. It is worth noting almost no hospitals scheduled the appointment for Saturdays.*

*There were about 800-1000 no-show cases during the given period.*

## Limitations
Due to the lack of scheduled appointment hours in the dataset, it was not possible to analyse the specific parts of the days when the patients would not come.

Moreover, the location, illness and week_day based values of no-show cases were large due to the overall value counts of the dataset.
