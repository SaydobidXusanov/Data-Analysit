# Data-Analyst
This repository includes my personal project solutions on Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The course requires passing the following **five** final projects, and it enables choosing datasets. Here are my projects:

* [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/SaydobidXusanov/Data-Analyst/tree/main/Explore-Weather-Trends)
* [No-show Medical Appointments](https://github.com/SaydobidXusanov/Data-Analyst/tree/main/No-show%20Medical%20Appointments)
* [Practical Statistics: A/B Testing](https://github.com/SaydobidXusanov/Data-Analyst/tree/main/AB-Testing-Ecommerce)
* [Data Wrangling: X (formerly Twitter) WeRateDogs Reviews](https://github.com/SaydobidXusanov/Data-Analyst/tree/main/Data-Wrangling-WeRateDogs)
* Airline Flights Analysis

Here is my **certificate** of Nanodegree completion:
